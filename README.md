# SCHIZO
A game developed in Godot Script to bring awareness to schizophrenia. 

## Plot
You are a person who recently got diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
Doing your daily tasks such as grocery shopping at a convenient store; random events will appear infront of you, unsure if its reality or just a delusion.
As weeks go by, these delusions get worse. 
At the end of four weeks, you'll be graded with an score; your score will go up the more you interact with delusions, however it will also go up the less you interact with reality.
